# Commute-Sense(Solution)
# AI-Driven Dynamic Public Transportation Scheduler

Efficiently managing public transportation in urban areas is a significant challenge, especially with fluctuating commuter demand, traffic variations, and unexpected events. This project aims to develop an AI-driven platform that autonomously schedules and dispatches public transport vehicles, ensuring dynamic adaptability and optimized efficiency.

## Problem Statement

As urban populations grow, managing public transportation to meet dynamic demand becomes more complex. Traditional scheduling systems often struggle to adapt to real-time fluctuations in commuter demand, traffic conditions, or unscheduled events like concerts, sports matches, and road closures. This can result in:

- Overcrowded buses or trains.
- Under-utilized vehicles.
- Longer commute times and delays.

These inefficiencies impact both commuters and transportation authorities, necessitating an intelligent, adaptive system for real-time scheduling and routing.
